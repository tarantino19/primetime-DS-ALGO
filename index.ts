//Linear Search

//It's very good practice to visualize the problem first before we program it
// white board - boxes, arrows- then program it
//crucial skill that will serve me for the rest of my life

//SEARCH - Finding a value from a data structure

//Search on an Array
//Linear Search

//we have an array where we wanna find a value inside an array?
//best is linear search - finding v, hey are you v, then next array? are you v? till we find it.

//1 - ask what's the worst case? e.g. what if we never find the one we're looking for?
//it will go from o to N - we keep doubling the space
//o(n)
// input grows, time it takes grows as well
